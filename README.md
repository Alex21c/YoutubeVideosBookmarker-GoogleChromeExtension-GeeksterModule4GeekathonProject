## 10. License
[GNU General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License)
Imagine you have a delicious recipe you created. A GNU license is like a special way of sharing the recipe. It allows people to:
1. **Cook the recipe (use the software):** Everyone can freely use the software for whatever they want.
2. **Learn the recipe (understand how it works):** They can access the code and see how the software works internally.
3. **Share the recipe with others (share the software):** They can freely copy and distribute the software to their friends.
4. **Improve the recipe (modify the software):** If they want, they can even change the code to make the software better and then share their improvements with everyone.
5. **But there's a twist:** if they share their improved recipe (modified software), they have to share it under the same "recipe card" (license) so everyone can benefit from their changes. This ensures the software remains free and open for everyone.
